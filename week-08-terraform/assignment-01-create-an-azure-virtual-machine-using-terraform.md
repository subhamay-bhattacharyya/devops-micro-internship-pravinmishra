# Assignment 1 — Create an Azure Virtual Machine using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision a complete Azure Virtual Machine environment, including a resource group, virtual network, subnet, public IP, network interface, and a Linux-based virtual machine. You will set up and verify the required local tools, define the infrastructure in Terraform, initialize the project, review and apply the plan, verify the running VM through Azure CLI, capture the public IP output, and destroy the resources after testing.

# Task 0 — Set Up and Verify the Terraform and Azure CLI Environment

## Goal

Prepare your local environment for Terraform deployment by installing Terraform, Azure CLI, and the HashiCorp Terraform extension in VS Code, signing in to your Azure account, and confirming that all required tools are working correctly.
